as recommended, I started with
  "whatever' or '1'='1" for the password
and then followed by
  "' or password like 'e%" or "' or password like 'ki%" for the password and such.

However, I've noticed that username field didn't even matter.
I left it blank and went with different variation of
' or password like 'k% and such, I could still login with different users.

According to the output, I think it's because due to that it adds or condition, that it is able to pass the user verification process.
